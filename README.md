## movie app


Check out my New movie app that I have programmed with React.JS! 

This is a movie app that uses React.js, Tailwind CSS, a REST API, and Firebase. It allows users to browse and search for movies, view details, and rate and review them. It has a modern interface and stores user data in a real-time Firebase database. It's a feature-rich, responsive app for movie lovers.
